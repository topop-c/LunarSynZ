Thank you for choosing to use Lunar's custom UI for Synz, hope you like it! It is 100% free at the moment. You can download by navigating to 'Releases', and extracting the .zip. To complete, you will need to copy the SynZ Launcher into Lunar's folder. If you have any issues feel free to join the discord server and ask for support, or DM me for help. Peace!
